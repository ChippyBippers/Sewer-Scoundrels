Overview:
You are a rat, living in the deepest recess of a long-since abandoned sewer system. 
It is now a festering ground for all sorts of pests like yourself. 
This would usually be great, but as it turns out there’s not much food in abandoned underground sewer systems and nobody’s very happy about it. 
You, being the only sensible rat in this place, have decided to seek a better life on the surface. 
However, you’ll have to travel up several floors of twisted bricks & cobble, facing off with the other denizens of this dark, damp and utterly unpleasant place.
